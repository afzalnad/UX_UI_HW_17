                    User Research
                </h3>
                <p>Research is one of my favorite parts of UX and I think it is important to get a good understanding of who your user is and what their needs are. It also helps to contextualize the project.</p>

                <h3>User Empathy</h3>

                <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>I enjoy talking to users and getting to know who they are as people because it allows me to get a better understanding of the demographic that will be using the product.</p>
